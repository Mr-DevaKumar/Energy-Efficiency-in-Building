## Energy Efficiency in Smart Buildings: Machine Learning Model to Predict Heating Load
 
Overview: This project leverages machine learning to improve energy efficiency in buildings, with a focus on predicting heating load based on building characteristics. Given the high energy consumption of buildings globally (around 40%), optimizing energy use is critical for sustainability. Using real-world data on building dimensions, wall types, and glazing areas, the model identifies inefficiencies and offers insights that help buildings move toward net-zero energy goals.

Project Outline:
    Data Exploration: Conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the data structure and relationships among variables.
    Data Preprocessing: Included handling missing values, feature scaling, and other steps to prepare data for modeling.
    Modeling and Evaluation: Implemented multiple regression models to compare performance:
        Linear Regression
        Decision Tree Regressor
        Random Forest Regressor
        Gradient Boosting Regressor
    Feature Analysis: Analyzed feature importance to determine which attributes significantly influence the heating load, offering actionable insights for energy management.
    Results and Insights: Compiled key findings, model comparisons, and suggestions for future improvements.
